# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling within route handlers, specifically when interacting with databases.

The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks robust error handling, which can result in cryptic error messages for the client or even application crashes.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling, ensuring that errors are properly logged and informative error responses are returned to the client.
